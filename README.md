# DATA1202-FINAL-ASSIGNMENT
## Introduction
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for Data 1202 Lab 3: Data Analytics Tools. The objective in this lab is to discover different ways to convert categorical features to numerical values. The notebook contains step-by-step explanations and code solutions of:
- Replacing value: Substituting specific values in a dataset
- Encoding labels: Labeling categorical variables with numbers
- One-Hot encoding: Coverting categorical variables into binary numbers (numerical numbers)
Encoding categorical data is crucial for machine learning models, because majority of machine learning models require numerical data. This lab shows how to use several encoding methods and analyze the outcomes
## Getting Started
### Required library
To run this notebook, we will need to have python installed with some of important libraries:
